## Synopsis

After [leaving Helm's Hold and traveling to the Mere of Dead Men](https://github.com/half-ogre/the-old-monster-shop#introduction), the orphans stood at the trailhead that would lead to the orcish war-pit Dumal marked on the map he'd given them. The fog over the march was thick; Emory could only see 10 yards ahead, making the trail difficult to follow. After an hour of hard travel, and seeing signs of troglodytes regularly using the same trail, the adventurous pair arrived at the war-pit.

The entrance was a crude, well-like circle of stacked stones fencing in a wide hole leading down in the dark pit below. Seeing and hearing nothing, Emory gave his rope and a torch to Alton, tying one end of the rope to some brush. Alton descended into the pit, which was 20 feet down. There he found an open, earthen chamber, roughly round, about 10 yards in diameter. In addition to the hole above, there was a single tunnel leading out of the chamber.

Finding nothing but remains of previous habitaion (food scraps, nesting material, a cold fire pit), Alton moved forward into the tunnel, rope still tied around his waist. After another 20 feet, the tunnel opened up into anothe chamber. Alton could hear signs of frantic scurrying ahead in this second chamber, and decided to turn back. As he did, a small, young troglodyte jumped to attach him.

Meanwhile, above ground, two fat, adult, many-boobied troglodytes tried to sneak up on Emory. He heard them before they could attack, and fired an arrow at one while sending his owl to harry the other. His arrow struck the troglodyte's heart, felling it nearly instantly. The other closed on Emory, forcing him to shoot at point-blank range while exposing himself to her attack.

Below, Alton had brought his blessed warhammer up in time to deflect the young troglodyte's attack. The slightly wounded troglodyte assumed a defensive position, allow Alton to withdraw and climb back up the hole. He surfaces to find the second troglodyte in melee with Emory, so he immediately attacked with his  warhammer. Between an arrow from Emory, the aid of his owl, and Alton's heavy hammer, the second troglodyte was quickly dispatched, but not before she let out shrieking howl that was answered by more howls from down in the pit.
