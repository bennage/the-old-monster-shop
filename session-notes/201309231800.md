## Synopsis

After [leaving Helm's Hold and traveling to the Mere of Dead Men](https://github.com/half-ogre/the-old-monster-shop#introduction) in search of troglodyte eggs, the orphans found the trailhead leading to the orcish war-pit Dumal marked on their map. The fog over the marsh was so thick that Emory could only see 10 yards ahead, making the trail difficult to follow. After an hour of challenging travel, and signs of troglodytes all around, the adventurous pair arrived at their destination.

The war-pit's entrance was a crude circle of stacked stones fencing in a wide hole leading down into the dark pit below. Seeing and hearing nothing, Emory gave a tortch and his rope to Alton, tieing one end to some brush and the other around Alton's waist. He descended into the pit, finding its floor 20 feet down. The earthen chamber was small and roughly round, with a single tunnel leading south.

Finding nothing but the remains of previous habitaion (food scraps, rent clothes, broken gear, and a cold fire pit), Alton moved forward into the tunnel, rope still tied around his waist. After another 20 feet, the tunnel opened up into another, larger chamber. Alton could hear signs of frantic scurrying in the dark ahead, and decided to turn back. As he did, a small, young troglodyte jumped out of the darkness to attach him.

At the same time, above ground, two fat, adult, many-breasted troglodyte mothers tried to sneak up on Emory. He heard them before they could attack, and fired an arrow at one while commanding his owl to harry the other. His arrow struck the troglodyte's chest, felling it immediately. The other closed on Emory, forcing him to shoot at point-blank range while exposing himself to her attacks.

Below, Alton moved his blessed warhammer up just in time to deflect the young troglodyte's attack. Slightly wounded by the blow, the troglodyte assumed a defensive position, wihch allowed Alton to withdraw and climb back up the hole. He surfaced to find the second troglodyte moether in melee with Emory, and he immediately attacked with his warhammer. An arrow from Emory, the aid of his owl, and Alton's heavy hammer all contributed to the demise of the second troglodyte, but not before she let out shrieking howl that was quickly answered by more howls from down in the pit.
